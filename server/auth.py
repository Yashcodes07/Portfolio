"""Demo-grade auth, stdlib only.

* Passwords: scrypt (n=2^14, r=8, p=1) with a 16-byte random salt.
* Sessions: random token stored in the `sessions` table, sent as an HttpOnly,
  SameSite=Lax cookie (`Secure` when the request arrived over https). 30 days.
  The same token is also returned in the sign-in body and accepted as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — that is how the mobile template (Expo,
  a different origin and no cookie jar on web) authenticates.
* Login throttle: 5 failed attempts per IP per minute (in-memory).
* Every document route depends on `current_user`, so data is per-user.

* Guest mode: `POST /api/auth/guest` mints an anonymous account (provider
  'guest', unusable password) + session, so an app can skip the sign-in
  screen entirely and still keep per-user data on the server. The guest can
  later `POST /api/auth/upgrade {email, password}` to turn it into a real
  account without losing anything.

What this is NOT: email verification, password reset, roles/admin, OAuth.
Tell users so — the web-builder summary template does.
